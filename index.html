                <p>Online sessions are conducted on Zoom</p> <br>
                <p>Since the Pandemic the use of Online methods of communicating has grown exponentially. It has become
                    a vital alternative and improved access to counselling for many who would struggle to attend
                    in-person sessions. It can even be the preferred option. Many feel more comfortable in their own
                    home and dislike the stress of travelling and parking.
                </p> <br>
                <p>If you choose this mode of therapy there are some considerations. Firstly it is helpful to ensure you
                    have a quiet, private, and comfortable space from which to base yourself during the sessions.
                    Secondly download an up-to-date version of Zoom via their website https://zoom.us/ , and have the
                    use of a device it is comfortable to use to talk on. Finally it important to plan for any
                    technological breakdowns - this will be discussed prior to commencement of therapy.

                </p> <br>
                <p>What is Walk and talk therapy? <br>
                    It is simply that we walk and talk without the constraints of being inside. Some clients are more
                    comfortable walking and talking and find it easier to start discussing their problems when strolling
                    along a country path.
                </p> <br>
                <p>I am happy for my client to set the pace of the walk if they want to meander along and have a
                    relaxing walk that is fine, but equally, we can set a quicker pace if that is what they feel
                    comfortable with. The footpaths are easy to walk and can start from my front door or the Local
                    National Trust woods and beach I am lucky to live near. So, in other words, you do not have to be
                    super fit!
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    Just being connected to nature can be beneficial. I find that whatever people's problems are
                    depression, anxiety, loss and grief, or any kind of difficult life transition, whether they are
                    personal, relationship-based, family or work-related they can be comfortably talked through while
                    walking. Walking can help to ground you and that in itself is good.

                        support. Some people associate counselling with shorter issue-focused work and psychotherapy
                        with longer open-ended personal development work. I use the terms interchangeably and will

                        However on the flip side counselling can be a difficult and challenging process.

                        The counselling relationship can be therapeutic itself. It offers the chance to experience a
                        secure, trusting and healthy attached relationship with a safe, kind and boundaried person who
                        is reliable, non judgemental and consistent.

                    <p>I believe that a good relationship between therapist and client has a big impact on the
                        effectiveness of therapy, so I offer a free 30 minute initial consultation to see if working
                        together feels right for both of us. This gives you a chance to find out more about how I
                        work and whether I am the right fit for you, and for me to get a sense of what you are
                        looking for from therapy and whether I can support you with that, or whether another type of
                        service might be more appropriate for you.

                            causing a split/loss of true self as they try to fit into the world around them.ƒ</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Psychodynamic therapy - focuses on unconscious process that were often formed in the past,
                            and how they manifest in the clients present behaviour. The goal is to increase the clients
                            self-awareness and understanding of the past on present day life and choices.</li>
                        <li>Mindfulness-based and compassion-focused therapy approaches - exploring acceptance,
                            self-compassion, and non-judgement towards ourselves, as well as considering how our social
                            world and relationships impact on each of us, and how stress on our bodies affect our
                            emotional experiences. </li>
                        <li>Polyvagal informed theory - This is a neurobiological approach to understanding the link
                            between our brain and body. It emphasises the importance of the Autonomic Nervous System in
                            making us feel safe and connected.ƒ</li>

                    <p>The process of counselling itself is straightforward. Come and speak about whatever is on your
                        mind. Seemingly small or unimportant discussions can often turn out to be essential aspects of
                        therapy. Try not to worry about what to bring, relax and see what comes up. I can work weekly,
                        and fortnightly if required. <br> <br>

                        I work relationally and your comfort and security with me is paramount. Our sessions will last
                        60 minutes and we will talk about whatever you wish to discuss. We will work at a speed set by
                        you and what we talk about is entirely led by you. I will not make you talk about anything that
                        you are not comfortable discussing. <br> <br>

                        Following your lead we can explore with curiosity what has brought you to counselling. We can
                        look at what is happening here and now but also take into account past experiences that are
                        continuing to impact you in the present. We can also consider how communication with people in
                        your life affects you. The more you learn about yourself, who you are and what you want, the
                        more you can understand what you need to be able to live the way you choose.

                    <p>We will work together each week until you find the best point to leave. This may be after a few
                        sessions or you may find you benefit from longer term work. You will feel when it is the right
                        time for you to stop, and I will support you with this. I may ask you to fill in outcome
                        measures and an evaluation to assist me in providing a better service to future clients.
