                <p>Online sessions are conducted on Zoom</p> <br>
                <p>Since the Pandemic the use of Online methods of communicating has grown exponentially. It has become
                    a vital alternative and improved access to counselling for many who would struggle to attend
                    in-person sessions. It can even be the preferred option. Many feel more comfortable in their own
                    home and dislike the stress of travelling and parking.
                </p> <br>
                <p>If you choose this mode of therapy there are some considerations. Firstly it is helpful to ensure you
                    have a quiet, private, and comfortable space from which to base yourself during the sessions.
                    Secondly download an up-to-date version of Zoom via their website https://zoom.us/ , and have the
                    use of a device it is comfortable to use to talk on. Finally it important to plan for any
                    technological breakdowns - this will be discussed prior to commencement of therapy.

                <p>Walk and Talk therapy or ecotherapy is something I am hoping to offer later in 2024.
                </p> <br>
                <p>What is Walk and talk therapy? <br>
                    It is simply that we walk and talk without the constraints of being inside. Some clients are more
                    comfortable walking and talking and find it easier to start discussing their problems when strolling
                    along a country path.
                </p> <br>
                <p>I am happy for my client to set the pace of the walk if they want to meander along and have a
                    relaxing walk that is fine, but equally, we can set a quicker pace if that is what they feel
                    comfortable with. The footpaths are easy to walk and can start from my front door or the Local
                    National Trust woods and beach I am lucky to live near. So, in other words, you do not have to be
                    super fit!
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    Just being connected to nature can be beneficial. I find that whatever people's problems are
                    depression, anxiety, loss and grief, or any kind of difficult life transition, whether they are
                    personal, relationship-based, family or work-related they can be comfortably talked through while
                    walking. Walking can help to ground you and that in itself is good.
