            <p>I am a qualified counsellor and psychotherapist based in Southport, Merseyside. I completed my training
                at the University of Central Lancashire, and am a registered member of the British Association of
                Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). You can find me on the list of registered members on the BACP
                website. As a member of the BACP, I abide by its ethical framework, which includes regular supervision
                of my work, as well as Continuous Professional Development (CPD).
            </p> <br> 
            <p>You can find my profile on the following websites, which require verification of qualifications,
                professional registration, and experience: <br>
                <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/profile/8bd25b82-b3a6-ea11-a812-000d3ab1967a/Therapist">British
                    Association of Counselling & Psychotherapy (BACP)</a>
            </p> <br>

            <p>I run my private practice and also work as a Volunteer Counsellor at a local Women's centre. Prior to
                starting my career in counselling, I worked as a Community Mental Health Nurse for 10 years and had a
                career break to raise my family.
            </p> <br> 
            <p>I am a member of a 'Neurospicy' family, which enables me to have a deeper understanding and appreciation
                of difference, diversity and acceptance. I welcome, acknowledge and respect clients of all backgrounds,
                regardless of ethnicity, culture, religion, neurotype, sexual orientation and gender identity. I work to
                understand the impact of these on mental health and wellbeing. I endeavour to practise in a way that is
                anti-oppressive and accessible and take a Health At Every Size approach.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                I offer short and long term counselling and psychotherapy in central Southport and online to provide a
                confidential, supportive space for you to explore your thoughts, feelings and experiences. You might
                seek counselling and psychotherapy because you are struggling to cope, feeling dissatisfied with your
                life, having problems with relationships, trying to process a loss or a change, or finding it difficult
                to make a big decision.

            </p> <br>
            <p>You might want to make sense of things that have happened in the past, think about your future or get
                some extra support to help you through a tough time. Perhaps you feel worried all the time, overwhelmed
                by emotions, are chronically stressed or can't feel much of anything. These are all good reasons to come
                to counselling and no problem is too small for therapy if it's troubling you.
            </p> <br>
            <p>My approach sees each person as an individual with different therapeutic needs, rather than one size of
                therapy fitting all. This means I work flexibly to suit you but with a focus on creating a strong
                relationship between us, working together to meet your goals, and supporting you to find your own
                answers rather than providing advice.
            </p> <br>
            <p>I have experience working therapeutically with a variety of issues including anxiety, depression, loss
                and grief, relationship difficulties, low self-esteem, loss of direction, chronic health issues, and
                problems at work
